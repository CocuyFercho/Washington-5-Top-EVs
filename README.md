# Washington-5-Top-EVs
This epository contains documents &amp; data used in my Capstone project for Google Data Analytics

As the last of my courses in the Coursera - Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
I has to work on a Capstone Project. I decided to create my own project using some open 
public datasets regarding the number of EVs (electrical vehicles) in Washington State.
The project starts with a ficticious company hiring the company were supposilly you work,
to carry some investigation and in my case was around the EVs in Washington state.

## CASE STUDY: 
Analysis to identify the two preferable cities in Washington State to use
as pilot sites for the installation of ZAP EV PowerHood.

## Scenario
As a junior data analyst working in a data consultancy company, I form part of our 
internal working group assembled to assist one of our clients, company ZAP. ZAP is 
a company working in the area of power electronics and artificial intelligence and 
it is ready to try out one of its new inventions: the EV PowerHood. The general idea 
of the EV PowerHood is to interconnect several EVs connected to their chargers and that 
are located in the same proximity area.  EV PowerHood optimizes their combine operation 
to provide electrical power to the homes of the EV owners and EVs that need to charge. 
Combining several EVs allows for a large pool of energy that will reduce the energy cost of the EV owners. 

The ZAP directors of marketing, finances and research are leading a project to analyse
the market conditions in Washington State. The company has chosen this State because of 
its average income level and the general attitude of its population to be early adapters
of electronic devices in general. As part of a pilot program ZAP company is interested in 
deploying its EV PowerHood systems to two cities. The cities should be on the top 5 cities
in terms of EV numbers and should be close to a balanced and homogeneous distribution of EVs
across the city. Additionally, they want to know which are the top electric vehicles makers 
in the chosen cities to analyse plugs and electronics compatibility with their system. Finally, 
they want to understand the development in time of the number EVs in the chosen cities and 
the evolution of the number of EVs in terms of makers.

## Important note
Only some of the files were uploaded here because of maximum file size allowance at Github.

Only one of the input datasets is founded here. 
You can find the datasets here:
Electric Vehicle Population Data (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2).

Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity (https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Title-and-Registration-Activity/rpr4-cgyd).

Similarly other intermediate calculation files were not possible to upload here.

The report is a very good guide to the methods and analysis use in this prroject.
